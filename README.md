## 📜 Game Rules

### Objective
Complete the grid by filling every cell with diagonal slashes (`\` or `/`) while satisfying all numbered constraints and avoiding loops.

### Three Core Rules

#### 1️⃣ Fill Every Cell
- Every square cell must contain exactly one diagonal slash
- Two types available:
  - **Left Slash (`\`)**: Connects top-left corner to bottom-right corner
  - **Right Slash (`/`)**: Connects top-right corner to bottom-left corner

#### 2️⃣ Satisfy Number Constraints
- Some intersection points (corners where cells meet) have numbers on them
- These numbers indicate how many lines must touch that specific point
- Valid constraint numbers: **0, 1, 2, 3, or 4**
- **Example**: A corner marked "2" must have exactly 2 lines connecting to it

#### 3️⃣ No Loops Allowed
- The slashes must NOT form any closed loops or cycles
- Lines can branch and connect, but cannot circle back to form a complete loop
- **Valid**: Lines that branch out like a tree
- **Invalid**: Lines that connect back to themselves forming a cycle

## 🎯 How to Play

### Single Player Mode (Default)

1. **Place Slashes**:
   - **Single Click**: Toggle between `\` and `/` slash types
   - **Double Click**: Clear the cell

2. **Visual Feedback**:
   - **Green Numbers**: Constraint satisfied ✅
   - **Red Numbers**: Constraint violated ❌
   - **Yellow Numbers**: Constraint not yet satisfied ⚠️
   - **Red Slashes**: Part of a detected loop 🔄

3. **Win Condition**:
   - All cells filled
   - All constraints satisfied
   - No loops present

### Multiplayer Mode

1. **Enable Multiplayer**:
   - Click the **"Multiplayer"** button
   - Select one of three CPU strategies:
     - **Strategy 1**: Constraint-Focused (logical, methodical)
     - **Strategy 2**: Edge-First (perimeter-focused)
     - **Strategy 3**: Random-Greedy (unpredictable)
   - Click **"Confirm"**

2. **Turn-Based Play**:
   - Players alternate turns (Human vs CPU)
   - CPU automatically plays after each human move (1.5s delay)
   - Both players compete for the highest score

3. **Victory**:
   - Player with the **highest total score** wins
   - If scores are equal: **Draw**

### Controls

| Button | Function |
|--------|----------|
| **New Game** | Start a fresh puzzle with randomly generated constraints |
| **Undo** | Revert the last move |
| **Multiplayer** | Toggle between single-player and multiplayer modes |
| **Solve** | Auto-complete the puzzle using backtracking algorithm |
| **Board Size** | Choose grid size: 3×3, 5×5, 7×7, or 9×9 |

## 💯 Scoring System

### Overview
Points are awarded based on strategic placement and puzzle-solving skill. Both human and CPU use **identical scoring criteria** for fairness.

### Scoring Criteria

#### 🎯 Base Move Points
- **Award**: +1 point
- **Condition**: Every valid move
- **Purpose**: Rewards participation and progress

#### ⭐ Constraint Satisfaction Bonus
- **Award**: +2 points per constraint satisfied
- **Condition**: When your move completes a numbered node's requirement
- **Example**: If a node marked "2" needs 2 connections and your move provides the 2nd connection, you earn +2 bonus points
- **Maximum per move**: Up to +8 points (if satisfying 4 constraints simultaneously)

#### 🏆 Perfect Cell Bonus
- **Award**: +3 points
- **Condition**: All 4 corners around your cell have their constraints fully satisfied
- **Purpose**: Rewards creating complete, valid regions
- **Note**: Only applies if at least one corner has a numbered constraint

#### 🎲 Strategic Position Bonus
- **Award**: +1 point
- **Condition**: Move is placed within 1 cell of the board's center
- **Purpose**: Encourages strategic positioning

### Scoring Examples

| Scenario | Points Breakdown | Total |
|----------|------------------|-------|
| Basic move (no constraints) | 1 (base) | **1** |
| Complete one constraint | 1 (base) + 2 (constraint) | **3** |
| Complete two constraints | 1 (base) + 2 + 2 | **5** |
| Perfect cell (all 4 corners satisfied) | 1 (base) + 4 (constraints) + 3 (perfect) | **8** |
| Optimal strategic move (center + perfect) | 1 (base) + 4 + 3 (perfect) + 1 (center) | **9** |

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Algorithms Used

#### Cycle Detection
- **Algorithm**: Depth-First Search (DFS)
- **Purpose**: Detect loops in the slash grid
- **Implementation**: Graph traversal with visited tracking
- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E) where V = nodes, E = edges

#### Constraint Satisfaction
- **Algorithm**: Degree counting at graph nodes
- **Purpose**: Verify numbered constraints are met
- **Implementation**: Count edges touching each node
- **Validation**: Real-time validation on each move

#### Greedy AI Strategies
- **Strategy 1 - Constraint-Focused**:
  - Prioritizes cells adjacent to constraint nodes
  - Scoring: +0.5 for satisfying constraints, +0.2 for approaching constraints
  
- **Strategy 2 - Edge-First**:
  - Starts from edges and works inward
  - Scoring: +0.6 for constraints, +0.15 × distance from center
  
- **Strategy 3 - Random-Greedy**:
  - Adds randomness while still being greedy
  - Scoring: +0.4 for constraints + random noise (-0.3 to +0.3)

#### Backtracking Solver

## 💡 Strategy Guide

### High-Scoring Strategies

1. **Prioritize Constraint Nodes**
   - Moves that satisfy numbered nodes earn +2 bonus points each
   - Look for cells that can satisfy multiple constraints at once

2. **Create Perfect Cells**
   - Complete regions with all 4 satisfied corners for +3 bonus
   - Plan moves to create perfect cells strategically

3. **Center Positioning**
   - Fill center areas early for +1 strategic bonus
   - Center cells often affect more constraints

4. **Plan Ahead**
   - Think 2-3 moves ahead to avoid painting yourself into a corner
   - Watch out for potential loops

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ **Ignoring constraints**: Results in low scores and invalid boards
- ❌ **Creating loops**: Causes cycle detection warnings
- ❌ **Random placement**: Earns only base points (1 per move)
- ❌ **Rushing edges**: Missing strategic center bonuses
- ❌ **Not planning**: Getting stuck with no valid moves

### Tips for Beating the CPU

- 🎯 **Against Strategy 1**: Play unpredictably, don't follow obvious constraint paths
- 🎯 **Against Strategy 2**: Claim center cells early before CPU reaches them
- 🎯 **Against Strategy 3**: Be consistent and methodical to outscore random play
